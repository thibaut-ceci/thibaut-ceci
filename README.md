## Hello there 👋

My name is Thibaut and I’m a PhD student at **Géoazur**. <br>
I'm currently working on the determination of **focal mechanisms** and **moment magnitudes (Mw)** for earthquakes in mainland France and bordering regions. 

Here, you can explore some of my other projects related to my studies : <br>
🔹 **Sismoavalanche** <br>
🔹 **Earthquakes Classifier** <br>
🔹 **SeisDown** <br>

And side projects just for fun : <br>
🎮 **5B1C** <br>
