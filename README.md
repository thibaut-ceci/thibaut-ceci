## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thibaut and Iâ€™m a PhD student at GÃ©oazur. Iâ€™m currently working on the determination of focal mechanisms and moment magnitudes (Mw) for earthquakes in mainland France and bordering regions.
Here, you can also find some of my other projects :

- SismoAvalanche : This project aims to improve the understanding of avalanche collapse dynamics by exploring a new concept : avalanche entropy.
- Earthquakes Classifier : The goal of this topic is to create a method using machine learning (shallow learning) to know if a seismic signal is created by an earthquake or not.
- SeisDown : A lightweight and user-friendly software designed to facilitate the download of seismic data.
- 5B1C : A project analyzing League of Legends matches based on the video concept "1 Challenger vs 5 Bronzes" created by the content creator iReaz.
- Fire Emblem : A project focused on developing a playable level of the tactical RPG Fire Emblem using Python.
