## Hello there 👋

My name is Thibaut and I’m a PhD student at Géoazur. 
I'm currently working on the determination of focal mechanisms and moment magnitudes (Mw) for earthquakes in mainland France and bordering regions.

Here, you can explore some of my other projects related to my studies : 
🔹 Sismoavalanche
🔹 Earthquakes Classifier
🔹 SeisDown

And side projects just for fun :
